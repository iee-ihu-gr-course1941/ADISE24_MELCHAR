# ADISE24_MELCHAR

## Project explaination
This project is an implementation of the Blokus online game. It is a 2-player online game. One player creates a room and waits for another player to join. Once the second player joins the room, the game starts. Each player has their own board with the available blocks. By clicking on a block, the available moves on the main board are displayed. When the player selects their next move on the main board, the block disappears from their board and appears on the main board. Then, it is the second playerâ€™s turn.
